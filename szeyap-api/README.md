# Szeyap API

This is the Szeyap API, which uses the connexion framework. We build the api by describing it in a yml file using the OpenAPI spec. Connexion helps us by managing routing, request validation, auth, response validation, Swagger UI documentation, etc.

### Connexion
See the [Connexion docs](https://connexion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html), especially the [Request Handling](https://connexion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/request.html) page.

### OpenAPI Guide
Swagger provides a very nice documentation for OpenAPI. See all the ways you can structure the api description yaml file in the [Swagger OpenAPI docs](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)

### Opening up the autogenerated API documentation
Go to [`http://localhost:8000/api/ui`](http://localhost:8000/api/ui)

### Main Function
